SDLSample
=========

Sample code for using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer). Uses libSDL2 and will not work with version 1.2.

All source code is in a single file, Main.cpp. Also included is a Makefile for building on Linux,
though it's only been tested on Ubuntu. Nothing about this project is operating-system-specific, so
Mac and Windows users should be able to use this code if they create the appropriate solution/project
file.

Contributions are welcome if you'd like to create project files and/or build instructions for other
operating systems.

Slides were created with LibreOffice and are in the Presentation folder.

All .WAV files and images were created by the author and are also licensed under the MIT license.
The lion cub was photographed at the Oregon Zoo and the backgrounds were photographed near
Scappoose, OR along route 30.
