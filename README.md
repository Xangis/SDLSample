SDLSample
=========

Sample code for using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)

All source code is in a single file, Main.cpp. Also included is a Makefile for building on Linux,
though it's only been tested on Ubuntu. Nothing about this project is operating-system-specific, so
Mac and Windows users should be able to use this code if they create the appropriate solution/project
file.

Slides were created with LibreOffice and are in the Presentation folder.

All .WAV files and images were created by the author and are also licensed under the MIT license.
